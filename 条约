【Welcome to LIS SERVER】 
At LIS, we very much want our player base to behave peacefully and respond to rational conversations with the review team. 
You have complete freedom of speech on the server, but you cannot make any insulting remarks. 
PVP is allowed as long as it does not degenerate into bullying. 
Client mods (e.g. improved chats and minimaps) are allowed, as long as you don't abuse them to gain an unfair advantage in the game (i.e. flymod, x-ray mod). 
A punishment 
If the player does not respond to rational dialogue – i.e. if the player ignores the administrator's warnings – then there is only one penalty: permanent ban. 
We don't waste time playing with in-game resources, buildings or temporaries 
ban. As long as you are able to have a rational discussion and respect the work of other players, you will not be banned. But if you're not, any ban you incur will be permanent.
